                    <p>Michael Schumacher (/ˈʃuːmɑːkər/; German: [ˈmɪçaːʔeːl ˈʃuːmaxɐ] (listen); born 3 January 1969) is
                        a German former racing driver who competed in Formula One for Jordan, Benetton, Ferrari, and
                        Mercedes. Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with
                        Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records
                        for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)—which have since been
                        broken by Hamilton—while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77),
                        among others.

                        After beginning his racing career in karting, Schumacher enjoyed success in several junior
                        single-seater series. After a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian
                        Grand Prix, Schumacher was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first
                        and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling
                        Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in
                        the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in
                        1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented
                        sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in
                        2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes
                        from 2010 to 2012
                        Early years
                        Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990
                        Michael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3
                        January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and
                        Elisabeth Schumacher (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four,
                        his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it
                        into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he
                        became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts
                        and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing,
                        Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's
                        canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable
                        to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]
