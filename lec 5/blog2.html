                        <p>Enzo Ferrari was said to have been born on 18 February 1898 in Modena, Italy and that his
                            birth
                            was recorded on 20 February because a heavy snowstorm had prevented his father from
                            reporting
                            the birth at the local registry office; in reality, his birth certificate states he was born
                            on
                            20 February 1898, while the birth's registration took place on 24 February 1898 and was
                            reported
                            by the midwife.[2] He was the younger of two children to Alfredo Ferrari and Adalgisa
                            Bisbini,
                            after his elder sibling Alfredo Junior (Dino). Alfredo Senior was the son of a grocer from
                            Carpi, and started a workshop fabricating metal parts at the family home.[3] Enzo grew up
                            with
                            little formal education. At the age of 10 he witnessed Felice Nazzaro's win at the 1908
                            Circuito
                            di Bologna, an event that inspired him to become a racing driver.[4] During World War I he
                            served in the 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment of the Italian Army. His father Alfredo, and
